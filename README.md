# hello-world
This is my entry into the world of coding and we will see how this goes.

I am attempting to use GitHub so that I can build my own functioning scoreboard.  If I can, it will accomplish a dream of mine to complete, I'm excited.
Any helpful tips along the way would be of great help. I'm also interested in learning more about using the Raspberry Pi
If there are tips for getting more out of the Pi, then I will use them.  Who knows, maybe I write a software similar to
SSP for the Pi and market it.
